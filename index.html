<p>Hey! Welcome to the Journal- a long sought dream that finally culminated!</p>

<p>Starting my own blog has always been at the back of my mind, but which I always gave least of the priority owing to lethargy. So much have I cribbed about it that my wing-mates offered to even pay for the domain: just to make me going once and for all LOL </p>

<p>CoVid19 has been an unfortunate part of our lives and the resulting bout of empty schedules only demanded to be fairly compensated. So Vedant finally decided to start with a blog topic dearest to him. Do give it a good read and leave your kind comments in the 'Contact Me' section </p>

<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
