<p>Everyone, in their short lifespan here on Earth, undertakes one journey which turns out to be more than what one expects it to be. I had a lot of apprehensions about the Varanasi backpack my friends had been planning for quite some time. Like any other planned college trips, I had imagined it to not see the life beyond the Instagram group. But from the various Google Maps scoutings and the countless Youtube videos, I should have gotten the idea that the group was more than serious. Once I had straightened that fact out, I faced a new challenge: convincing my over-protective curry parents. It is not wrong to call it an Herculean task- with being thrown at with points like security in the state of Uttar Pradesh and what not- but I managed to pull it off without losing a limb. And thus we embarked on this epic adventure, not knowing what to expect even after all the meticulous planning. This series/blog is an account of the amazing days I spent in the spiritual capital that is Kashi.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Getting to Ground Zero</h2>

<p>Kashi did not welcome us with open hands. Rain poured from the sky like cats and dogs as soon as we stepped onto the platform. The low temperatures of December 2019 were of hardly any help. After quite an intense bargaining session with the autowallah, we dashed towards the parking with our heavy suitcases, having submitted to the eventuality of getting wet in the downpour. The four hefty city-boys, one of whom was half dangling out of the rickshaw in the rain, and a lean rickshaw driver was quite a comical sight for the roadside chai-sipping locals, for I could see plenty of white sets of teeth. As if the single-lane roads weren’t wide enough, the rickshawallah informed us that the remainder of our journey (approx 150m) had to be through the famous and extremely narrow gullies of Benaras.</p>

<p>The fragrance of hot piping kachoris couldn’t escape us so easily and as much as we were exhausted, the temptation of digging into hot chhole kachori was enough to convince us. The remaining part of the journey, though short, proved to be quite a pain in the ass. The rain had ensured that all the garbage thrown in the gully, sludge from man-hole covers and the occasional cow (I hope it's that in the least)-shit mix into an irritating slush through which we had to drag our suitcases. This and the enormous labyrinth of inter-connected gullies, with intersections of all possible shapes that a supercomputer can generate, that we navigated bore fruits only when we reached our extremely comfortable and plush hostel. We had finally made it. We had made it to Ground Zero.</P>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Gullies</h2>
<p>Walking through the gullies of Benaras is an overwhelming explosion of senses. It is a maze of narrow alleyways lined with ancient shops selling saffron kurtas emblazoned with the universal hymn Aum<, age-old silver wares, traditional Indian instruments like brass cymbals and dhols for aartis, green chaadar for praying at the mosque and not to mention, the frequent confectionaries with their fresh jalebis proudly on display.</p>

<p>It is so damn easy to get lost in the labyrinth- almost out of the Dr. Strange movie- especially if there is one friend in your group, and there is always such a fellow, who confidently proclaims that he is sufficient sans Google Maps. In Benaras, ignore the fellow. You. Will. Get. Lost. The story isn't so grim for, you do get to know the way pretty soon, for example, we had identified markers along a few key paths!</p>

<p>Varanasi is a beautiful amalgamation of contrasts- on one side on the road there will be a toy shop for toddlers while on the opposite side will be a roadside vendor of sandalwood for the funeral pyre, the sweet fragrance of hot chai in earthern kulhad will fight for your attention with cold thandai being churned violently in its pot and the hot piping samosas from North India tugging at you while you are pulled at from the opposite side by the fluffy and steamy idli from South India.</p>

<p>As you stroll along, you are reminded of the plethora of religions and communities living in harmony in India. Each turn exposes you to a new and a different community or culture be it mosques, Maharashtrian mathth, temple of Venkateshwara from the South or Jain derasar. At each step, your ears are bombarded with a myriad of sounds- chimes of bells from a distant temple, a random Bollywood number being played in a hair salon, Vasudevas from Deccan reciting bharuds and folklores, and a random cow moo-ing at you as it makes its way amidst the honking of motorbikes and the tring-tring of the bicycles- all this as you skip over a poorly discarded garbage bin.</p>
<p>The streets of Benaras have the complete package to offer</p>
