<p>Welcome to the second part of the Varanasi Travel Blog! In the first one, I covered those aspects of Varanasi which were the main motivating factors for us to choose it for our back-pack. This blog is my attempt to give justice to the spiritually enriching experiences that we had, something that Benaras had plenty to offer!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Temples</h2>
Varanasi is a meeting point of many religions thriving in India- like Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Islam. Naturally, the number of places of worships for each of these is pretty pretty high!</p>
<p>Out of the 23000 temples scattered around, we are satisfied with covering most of the significant ones :) This is great considering the fact that am not much of a religious person! </p>
<p>On the way to Ram Bhandar, we happened to cross the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, the most famous temple in Varanasi. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, it derives its name from Vishwanath: The Lord of the Universe. This temple has faced a lot of hardships in its history - being torn down and then resurrected back a multiple times- and this fact was somewhat visible, for, there are few broken ancient walls here and there, dilapidated and defaced statues and plenty of restored lingums and artifacts. What surprised us was the scanty number of worshippers in the Temple line so we paid a visit that very night. It was like the temple as opened just for us and we also got to witness the evening aarti along with the tasty prasadum. The temple complex was very well taken care of, considering its violent history and I would suggest visiting it at night just before the temple closes to avoid the rush.</p>
<p>Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple is a temple dedicated to the Hindu God Hanuman. This was quite a quirky temple as it is supposed to take away any bad influence Shani has on your horoscope. The temple isn't maintained as much as it deserves according to its importance and there were serpentine line sans any crowd management! Somewhat obviously, the temple complex was storming with langurs and macaques!</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">The Ghats</h2>

<p>Varanasi Ghats form the heart of the city, where most of the action takes place.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, the ghat is like the Marine Drive of Bombay- a continuous and picturesque outline of a waterbody that glitters with a dazzling show of lights, total 88 in number!</p>

<p>Albeit, the resemblance stops at that. Marine Drive borrows its lustre and aura from the modern man- what with all the concrete tetrapods, cement paver blocks, morning joggers wearing expensive Adidas arriving in their swanky Mercedes- that is, all the urban jargon.</p>


<p>No. The ghats of Varanasi have, fortunately, not been taken over completely by the modern man and this is where its value lies. The centuries old stone riverfront has supported history of the bygone eras. The path that you tread upon has also been blessed by the feet of many ancient Kings and Queens. The stone that you stand on had, probably, felt the brunt of so many yagyas being performed by so many guruvars and sadhus!</p>



<p>Chatting with a benarasi street peddler, as he serves you a cupful of hot steaming lemon tea, you cannot but think about the thousands of people like him over so many years that have earned their livelihood by peddling on those very ghats!</p>

<p>One of the most important events to take place on these ghats is the daily Ganga-Aarti. The aarti takes place twice a day – one early morning at 5AM and the other at night. With a lot of zeal and over-confidence, we would plan on attending the former one but obviously would not get up on time. The first time we got to witness the aarti was just a fortunate coincidence. We were at Assi Ghat to find some clubs, thinking that we were late for the evening aarti, when we heard the blow of conches. Just in time :) </p>

<span class="caption text-muted">The majestic Ganga Aarti</span>

<p>Ganga Aarti, as the name suggests, is a homage to Goddess Ganga and is what makes Varanasi so important and spiritual. As much as it is a prayer it is also a synchronised spectacle for the eye! The delicate movements of the wrist as they sway fans made of peacock feathers, the bellowing of the conches, the dancing flames emanating from the hand-held sam all makes up for an enchanting experience. If just the steps on the riverbank weren’t enough, opportunist canoe owners offer an excellent view of the aarti from the river.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Kashi-wale</h2>

<p>The one thing that can be said to be in common between Marine Drive and theghats is the myriad of humans you will get to meet and all it takes is a late-night walk along the river. </p>
<p>After witnessing our very first ganga aarti at the Assi Ghat, we thought we would prefer walking to Dashahwamedh Ghat- the main motivation being the amazing display of lights playing on the ancient walls. Ah!I am never going to forget this night!</p>
<p>So let me get this straight here- the ghats are not a continuous stretch of steps but rather staggered. One needs to jump sometimes from one ledge to another, bend a bit under over-passes and occasionally avoiding the randomly placed circular stones meant for propping umbrellas belonging to the priests and barbers.</p>

<p>We were parkouring and crossing one ghat after the other-waving at Sadhus enjoying the high from their devotion and meditation (I guess weed was more responsible than either) when we came across a foreigner gentleman with an unicycle, jumping between stones- carefully placed at strategic positions. Apparently, from among the small group of people gathered to appreciate his talents, one particular boy seemed eager to gain this knowledge. There were no words exchanged in this encounter among any of the involved parties- we filming, the foreigner gentleman and the local boy. It was just two humans exchanging their talents and knowledge (and us duffers with nothing to offer). This was just a raw display of human interaction- without a single word!</p>
<p>A little walk away, we chanced upon a couple of performers showing off their talents of balancing and weaving blades in the air in a very meticulous and hypnotizing way. All this with another guy playing drums at a distance, just near the bank of the river.</p>
<p>We then made our way further and came across another interesting set of people. Against the wall of a traditional Haveli, in the focal region of a projector light and the beats of a Bollywood song was a group of dancers showing off their moves and somersaulting here and there. Right across them, seated on the steps with their heads facing down, was another group of teenagers, clearly engrossed in sketching. A friendly chat and one of them introduced themselves as students of architecture from Ahmedabad! They even showed us their sketches which they had worked upon for the past couple of days and they were so lovely and articulate!</p>
<p>Not content with experiencing this wild side of Varanasi (it wasn’t even mentioned in any of the blogs or videos we watched for preparation for the trip), we thought it would be appropriate to take advantage of the misty night. We headed to the terrace of our hostel and sunk our bare feet into the wet dewy artificial grass, closed our eyes and floated away into the melodies of Frank Sinatra playing on my speaker.</p>
<p>We met such awesome people till we reached back to Bombay! We didnt carry much packed food for ourselves on the train and the couple who were travelling with us noticed it. They insisted on us helping ourselves to the awesome mutter puri the aunty had cooked. No amount of our courteous denial would workand we finally gave in! If nto for her, I am definite we would have starved that night!</p>
<p>And this is what travelling is mainly about- apart from experiencing new places of course- coming across such amazing people! You get to know the stories of so many people(and maybe become a part of their stories), get to know their cultures, eat their cooked meals :p and what not! </p>
