<p>Everyone, in their short lifespan here on Earth, undertakes one journey which turns out to be more than what one expects it to be. I had a lot of apprehensions about the Varanasi backpack my friends had been planning for quite some time. Like any other planned college trips, I had imagined it to not see the life beyond the Instagram group. But from the various Google Maps scoutings and the countless Youtube videos, I should have gotten the idea that the group was more than serious. Once I had straightened that fact out, I faced a new challenge: convincing my over-protective curry parents. It is not wrong to call it an Herculean task- with being thrown at with points like security in the state of Uttar Pradesh and what not- but I managed to pull it off without losing a limb. And thus we embarked on this epic adventure, not knowing what to expect even after all the meticulous planning. This series/blog is an account of the amazing days I spent in the spiritual capital that is Kashi.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Getting to Ground Zero</h2>

<p>Kashi did not welcome us with open hands. Rain poured from the sky like cats and dogs as soon as we stepped onto the platform. The low temperatures of December 2019 were of hardly any help. After quite an intense bargaining session with the autowallah, we dashed towards the parking with our heavy suitcases, having submitted to the eventuality of getting wet in the downpour. The four hefty city-boys, one of whom was half dangling out of the rickshaw in the rain, and a lean rickshaw driver was quite a comical sight for the roadside chai-sipping locals, for I could see plenty of white sets of teeth. As if the single-lane roads weren’t wide enough, the rickshawallah informed us that the remainder of our journey (approx 150m) had to be through the famous and extremely narrow gullies of Benaras.</p>

<p>The fragrance of hot piping kachoris couldn’t escape us so easily and as much as we were exhausted, the temptation of digging into hot chhole kachori was enough to convince us. The remaining part of the journey, though short, proved to be quite a pain in the ass. The rain had ensured that all the garbage thrown in the gully, sludge from man-hole covers and the occasional cow (I hope it's that in the least)-shit mix into an irritating slush through which we had to drag our suitcases. This and the enormous labyrinth of inter-connected gullies, with intersections of all possible shapes that a supercomputer can generate, that we navigated bore fruits only when we reached our extremely comfortable and plush hostel. We had finally made it. We had made it to Ground Zero.</P>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Gullies</h2>
<p>Walking through the gullies of Benaras is an overwhelming explosion of senses. It is a maze of narrow alleyways lined with ancient shops selling saffron kurtas emblazoned with the universal hymn Aum<, age-old silver wares, traditional Indian instruments like brass cymbals and dhols for aartis, green chaadar for praying at the mosque and not to mention, the frequent confectionaries with their fresh jalebis proudly on display.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

<p>It is so damn easy to get lost in the labyrinth- almost out of the Dr. Strange movie- especially if there is one friend in your group, and there is always such a fellow, who confidently proclaims that he is sufficient sans Google Maps. In Benaras, ignore the fellow. You. Will. Get. Lost. The story isn't so grim for, you do get to know the way pretty soon, for example, we had identified markers along a few key paths!</p>

<p>Varanasi is a beautiful amalgamation of contrasts- on one side on the road there will be a toy shop for toddlers while on the opposite side will be a roadside vendor of sandalwood for the funeral pyre, the sweet fragrance of hot chai in earthern kulhad will fight for your attention with cold thandai being churned violently in its pot and the hot piping samosas from North India tugging at you while you are pulled at from the opposite side by the fluffy and steamy idli from South India.</p>

<p>As you stroll along, you are reminded of the plethora of religions and communities living in harmony in India. Each turn exposes you to a new and a different community or culture be it mosques, Maharashtrian math (मठ), temple of Venkateshwara from the South or Jain derasar. At each step, your ears are bombarded with a myriad of sounds- chimes of bells from a distant temple, a random Bollywood number being played in a hair salon, Vasudevas from Deccan reciting bharuds and folklores, and a random cow moo-ing at you as it makes its way amidst the honking of motorbikes and the tring-tring of the bicycles- all this as you skip over a poorly discarded garbage bin.</p>
<p>The streets of Benaras have the complete package to offer</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">The food</h2>

<p>I would not be completely honest with you if I did not reveal that street food was the primary motive of us back-packing in Varanasi. Hell! We still don’t accept this fact without our cheeks showing a tinge of crimson! </p>

<p>I have two clear favourites here and I’ll get to them right at the end (:p). Let us start with the obvious choice here- the Benarasi paan. The one we ate had all the pomp and glory but had no bang, mostly because it was meant for tourists like us. It would be my suggestion to try the one that localites consume with generous amounts of kattha and chuna! Strong suggestion- Keshav Paan Bhandar!</p>

<p>Litthi Chokha was an amazing restaurant but the actual dish was on a disappointing side. I attribute this disappointment mostly because of my region of origin. Being from the Deccan region, I prefer my food to be spicy! But the concept and the location were fantastic and a definite to-visit spot of Varanasi!</p>

<p>Too much negativity? These were the only two items on the list that disappointed me. The rest were pure bliss!</p>

<p>We hurried along the gullies to walk four kilometers to reach Ram Bhandar. It was past noon and it had already gone sold-out! Hum toh dukhi the hi lekin humse jyada dukhi koi aur the (We were sad but there was someone sadder than us). An uncle had also succumbed to Sunday slumber and had missed the freshly-fried kachoris. Having noticed us, his sad face immediately  glowed with a smile. He took us to another kachoriwala nearby and the kachoris were oh-so-amazing! The only sad outcome was that the new guy was a legit street vendor so I don’t recollect its location! So if you do find yourself in a similar position, hope that you meet some sweet uncle who will have the same food craving as you!</p>

<p>We tried Kashi Chaat Bhandaar one evening for dinner and this is a MUST VISIT spot. You will be blown off by the variety of chaat they have on offer. You will like a lot of the dishes, especially the Palak Chat - it was something different form what I had ever eaten and quite an experience! To top it off, we stopped for some rabdi at a random shop in the Dashashwamedh market- it was orgasmic :)</p>

<p>Pehelwan Lassi of Kashi is quite famous but we couldn’t try it sadly but it brings me to the two of my favourite dishes that were new to me and I would give anything to have them delivered to me in Mumbai!</p>

<p>Malaiyo/Nimish is made from milk cream in the winters only because it involves the formation of dews. Fortunately for us, our timing couldn’t have been more perfect. The malaiyo shop opposite Ram Bhandaar was ethereal. You cannot be satisfied with just one serving, trust me!</p>

<p>Fried idli is definitely one of those things that I would like to go back to Varanasi for- not even kidding! It is just that- idli which is fried and served with a hot green and white coconut chutney as if complimenting each other! Fried Idli is the Vada Pav of Varanasi- and this coming from a Bombaiyya is a huge deal.</p>

<p>I believe that local and street food of any place says a lot about its history and the way of life of the locals. If there is no research paper to back me up on this, I would be more than happy to write it myself!</p>

<p>I am thoroughly enjoying writing this blog and it has turned out to be quite longer than I expected. Stay tuned as I follow it up with a part 2! </p>
