<p> I am an Under Graduate at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. The field of Microprocessors and their applications astounds me. The amount of logic and aptitude that is required in this field tickels the sweet spots in my brain. So if you are here after reading my technical blogs, feel free to share your views on the same </p>
<p> I like to discover new places. I have covered almost all of India and my memory is enriched with all the experiences! Travelling enables me to learn about varied cultures and take in scenic sights </p>
